  \frametitle{The developers training}
  \begin{block}{Objectives}
    This 4 days training will give you the first elements to:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Understand the OpenTURNS aim and architecture,
    \item Discover the coding rules, the development process and the associated infrastructure,
    \item Make your first steps in the OpenTURNS development by adding a new specialization of an existing concept both in the C++ library and the Python interface,
    \item Make your first steps in the OpenTURNS module development.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \frametitle{General organization}
  \begin{block}{Agenda}
    Each of these four days will be organized as follow:
    \begin{description}
    \item[10.00am] Welcome (coffee \& tea)
    \item[10.15am] Theory
    \item[12.30pm] Lunch
    \item[13.30pm] Theory or experimentation
    \item[15.30pm] Break (coffee \& tea)
    \item[15.45pm] Experimentation
    \item[18.00pm] End of the day
    \end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
% Day 1: uncertainties, package, architecture %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Day by day...}
  \begin{block}{Day 1: uncertainties, OpenTURNS platform, architecture}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Uncertainties: quick reminder on analysis, probability and statistics
    \item OpenTURNS platform: the global picture of OpenTURNS product and the website, short presentation of the development life-cycle.
    \item Architecture: the general organization of the product with some highlights on the key mechanisms and their implementation.
    \item Experimentation: basic manipulation of a numerical function and a probability distribution, navigation in the website (tickets, versioning system), exploration of examples in C++ and python.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
% Day 2: development in OpenTURNS: the C++ library part %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Day by day...}
  \begin{block}{Day 2: development in the C++ library}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The compilation infrastructure: some elements on CMake.
    \item The development process: architecture, C++ implementation, tests.
    \item Practical case: add a new distribution to the library.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
% Day 3: development in OpenTURNS: the python part %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Day by day...}
  \begin{block}{Day 3: make the development visible in python}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Interfacing C++ and Python using SWIG.
    \item The development process: SWIG interface, python modules, tests, documentation.
    \item Practical case: make a new distribution available from Python.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
% Day 4: development around OpenTURNS: create a module %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Day by day...}
  \begin{block}{Day 4: create an OpenTURNS module}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The concept of module, its standard structure.
    \item The key steps in the development of a module.
    \item How to install and use a module?
    \item Practical case: add a new distribution as a module.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Already a contributor}
  \begin{block}{You are a new OpenTURNS developer!}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item All the developments made during this training session will become part of OpenTURNS sooner or later, depending on their degree of maturity (quality ;) ?).
    \item The missing steps for a direct integration will be the testing phase, the validation phase and the documentation phase.
    \item The integration will be done using a development branch on GitHub.
    \end{itemize}
    Check the upcoming release or the next to see your work in action!
