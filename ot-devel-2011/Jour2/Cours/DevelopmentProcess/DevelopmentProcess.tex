% The tools %
%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Two compilation infrastructures}
  \begin{block}{The autotools}
    The autotools are a set of tools that aim to ease the configuration and compilation of large software projects in the UNIX world. The objective is to generate Makefiles from a set of templates and the information gathered during a configuration step. The main tools are:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{aclocal} in charge of the management of the several \emph{detection macros} needed for the configuration of the project: the dependencies, the compilers and so on.
    \item \emph{automake} in charge of producing parameterized Makefiles (\emph{Makefile.in}) from template Makefiles (\emph{Makefiles.am}).
    \item \emph{autoconf} in charge of the parameterization of both the Makefiles and the sources of the project (notably for the conditional compilation of parts of the project). The main purpose of this tool is to produce a shell script (\emph{configure}) based on a template (\emph{autoconf.ac}) and the macros gathered by aclocal (\emph{aclocal.m4}). This shell script converts the parameterized Makefiles (Makefile.in) into ready to use Makefiles.
    \item \emph{autotest} in charge of the unit tests. Such a test is described as an association between a shell script command to be executed and a reference standard output and error output that is expected. The validation is done using a character-based comparison of the shell script output and the reference output, and through the return code of the shell script command.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Two compilation infrastructures}
  \begin{block}{CMake}
    CMake is another compilation infrastructure with the same objectives as the autotools. All the configuration is done through a hierarchy of text files written in the CMake macro language, and a GUI is available to ease the creation of this hierarchy. The same topics are covered:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{dependency detection} through a set of detection macros: the several .cmake files;
    \item \emph{configuration} through a master configuration file: the top-level CMakeLists.txt file;
    \item \emph{source organization} through a set of CMakeLists.txt files disseminated in the whole source tree: each such file includes the declaration of the several source files and associated header files, and make a recursive call to the subdirectories.
    \item \emph{testing} using a mechanism that is not completely clear to me at this time...
    \end{itemize}

% Development process

\section[Development process]{Development process}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Development process}
  \begin{block}{Two main situations}
    There are two distinct situations in the development of additional capabilities of OpenTURNS:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The addition of a new instance of an existing concept;
      \item The introduction of a new concept.
    \end{itemize}
    The associated development process shares the same principles in both cases, but the details are more involved in the second case.\\
    Both cases are covered in the \alert{Contribution Guide} documentation that comes with OpenTURNS, only the first situation will be covered here. We suppose that our extension consist in the creation of a new class called MyClass in an existing directory.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
% Add a new class
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Populate an existing concept}
  \begin{block}{Step 1: create the header file and the associated source file}
    Create MyClass.hxx and MyClass.cxx in the same directory. The files must have the standard OpenTURNS header, with a brief description of the class using the Doxygen format and the standard reference to the LGPL license.
  
  For the header file MyClass.hxx, the interface must be embraced between the preprocessing clauses:
  
\begin{tabular}{l}
\ttfamily \#ifndef OPENTURNS\_MYCLASS\_HXX\\
\ttfamily \#define OPENTURNS\_MYCLASS\_HXX\\
\ttfamily ...\\
\ttfamily your interface\\
\ttfamily ...\\
\ttfamily \#endif OPENTURNS\_MYCLASS\_HXX
\end{tabular}
  
  to prevent from multiple inclusions.
  
  See any pair of .hxx/.cxx files in the current directory and the OpenTURNS Coding Rules document as a guide for your development: the use of namespaces, case convention for the static methods, the other methods and the attributes, the trailing underscore for the attribute names to name a few rules.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
% Add a new class
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Populate an existing concept}
  \begin{block}{Step 2: update the automake file and the CMake file}
    Modify the Makefile.am file in the directory containing MyClass.hxx and MyClass.cxx:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item add MyClass.hxx to the {\ttfamily otinclude\_HEADERS} variable
    \item add MyClass.cxx to the {\ttfamily libOTXXXXXX\_la\_\_SOURCES} variable, where XXXXXX is the name of the current directory.
    \end{itemize}
    Modify the CMakeList.txt file in the same directory:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item add MyClass.hxx using the instruction {\ttfamily ot\_install\_header\_file ( MyClass.hxx )}
    \item add MyClass.cxx using the instruction {\ttfamily ot\_add\_source\_file ( MyClass.cxx )}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Add a new class
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Populate an existing concept}
  \begin{block}{Step 3: the source code of the test(s)}
    Create a test file t\_MyClass\_std.cxx in the directory lib/test. This test file must check at least the standard functionalities of the class MyClass. If relevant, some specific aspects of the class can be checked in specific other test files, such as the exceptional behaviour of the class or its functionalities in extrem configurations (large data set, hard to solve problems etc.).
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Add a new class
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Populate an existing concept}
  \begin{block}{Step 4: the autotest file(s) of the test(s)}
    Create an autotest file t\_MyClass\_std.at in the directory lib/test. This file describes the test, how to run it and what is the expected output (copy-paste the \emph{validated} output of the test in the proper section of t\_MyClass\_std.at).\\
    For the CMake infrastructure, there is no such step.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Add a new class
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Populate an existing concept}
  \begin{block}{Step 5: update the automake file and the CMake file of the lib/test directory}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item add t\_MyClass\_std (which is the name of the test executable) to the variable CHECK\_PROGS or INSTALLCHECK\_PROGS depending on the fact the test checks the correct behaviour of OpenTURNS independently of its installation or not. The several executables are organized following the library organization, you must follow this rule.
  \item add t\_MyClass\_std.at to the variable CHECK\_TESTS or INSTALLCHECK\_TESTS and in the correct set of autotest files, following the same rules than for the executable.
  \item Create a variable called t\_MyClass\_std\_SOURCES and set its value to t\_MyClass.cxx in the relevant set of sources.
  \end{itemize}
  For the CMake infrastructure, add the line ot\_installcheck\_test ( MyClass\_std ) in the relevant section of the CMakeLists.txt file.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Add a new class
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Populate an existing concept}
  \begin{block}{Step 6: update the autotest infrastructure}
    Add t\_MyClass\_std.at to the file check\_testsuite.at or installcheck\_testsuite.at using the same rule than for the Makefile.am modification.\\
    If the test checks functionalities available after the installation of OpenTURNS, use the installcheck\_testsuite.at file as your test is a post-installation test, else use the check\_testsuite.at file.\\
    There is no such step in the CMake infrastructure.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Add a new class
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Populate an existing concept}
  \begin{block}{Step 7: validation}
    If the validation of your class involved advanced mathematics, or was a significant work using other tools, you can add this validation in the validation/src directory.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item copy all of your files in the validation/src directory.
    \item modify the Makefile.am file by appending the list of your files to the dist\_validation\_DATA variable.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Add a new class
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Document the new class}
  \begin{block}{Step 8: update the documentation}
    The documentation must be written in English, using LaTeX. For an addition to the C++ library, you may have to update the following documents in the OpenTURNS documentation source tree:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Add an entry in the document src/ArchitectureGuide/OpenTURNS\_ArchitectureGuide.tex if your class has a significant impact on the library architecture.
    \item Add an entry in the document src/WrappersGuide/OpenTURNS\_WrappersGuide.tex if your class has a significant impact on the way OpenTURNS interfaces external codes.
    \item Add an entry in the document src/ReferenceGuide/OpenTURNS\_ReferenceGuide.tex if your class add a new concept not already described in the reference guide. Your entry must take the form of a specific description using the same template than the other descriptions.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

% Critical points
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Tips and tricks}
  \begin{block}{Critical points}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item All the classes must include the {\ttfamily CLASSNAME} macro (defined in Base/Common/Object.hxx) in their header file in order to benefit from the (basic) introspection mechanisms. The associated {\ttfamily CLASSNAMEINIT} macro must be used in the corresponding source file.
    \item All the class corresponding to persistent objects must instantiate a static parameterized factory in their source file.
      \item In order to improve the readibility of the source code, the needed classes that are not in the current namespace must be aliased using a typedef. These typedef must be wisely separated between those in the header file and those in the source file.
      \item The const correctness of the code is very important, both for the signature of the methods and for the temporary variables.
      \item All the object arguments must be passed using const references. The use of non const references to make side effects must be limited as much as possible.
      \item Most of the coding rules are described in the Coding Rules Guide, but you can infer the rules by looking at the existing code. \alert{The key point is that the only difficult points should be the conception and the algorithms, not the indentation or the coding style!}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \frametitle{Development of a new distribution}
  \begin{block}{Practical case: adding a new distribution to the C++ library}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Each trainee has to implement a new distribution in the C++ library, this distribution being chosen without replacement in an urn containing a dozen of distributions.
    \item From an algorithmic point of view, the minimum to do is to implement the {\ttfamily NumericalScalar computeCDF(const NumericalPoint \& point)} method.
    \item From a development process point of view, each trainee is expected to go through at least the 6 first steps.
    \item The other methods should be added in the following order:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item {\ttfamily NumericalScalar computePDF(const NumericalPoint \& point)}
      \item {\ttfamily NumericalPoint getRealization()}
      \item {\ttfamily NumericalScalar computeScalarQuantile(const NumericalScalar prob, const Bool tail, const NumericalScalar precision)}
      \item {\ttfamily void computeMean() const}
      \item {\ttfamily void computeCovariance() const}
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
